# Development of a Veterinary App Using Firebase

## Abstract
This project focuses on the development of a veterinary application utilizing Firebase as the backend service. The app allows user authentication, animal management, and the use of Firebase's Firestore for cloud-based CRUD operations. Built using Node.js version 20.16.0, the project **achieves** compliance with academic requirements for functionality and performance.

## 1. Introduction
The veterinary app aims to **facilitate** professionals in managing a list of animals with functionalities such as user authentication, animal registration, and the display of detailed information for each animal. Firebase's JavaScript SDK provides the necessary backend support for authentication and data handling. The app is **developed** to **streamline** the process of animal management, leveraging cloud technology.

## 2. App Structure
The application includes four key views:

### 2.1 Login View
Users can log in by providing their credentials. The app authenticates them using Firebase, **evaluating** credentials and **executing** navigation to the main menu or showing error messages as needed.

### 2.2 Sign Up View
New users can register by creating an account. Upon successful registration, the user is authenticated and redirected to the main menu. The app **facilitates** user management by **validating** credentials and **organizing** user data.

### 2.3 Main Menu
The main menu features a list of animals, **collected** and **organized** from Firebase Firestore. Each animal can be selected to view its detailed information. Additionally, users can **add** new animals through a dedicated interface, **designed** to **simplify** the process of registering animal data.

### 2.4 New Animal View
This view allows users to input and submit new animal data (name, age, and picture URL) to Firebase Firestore. The data is then displayed in the main menu and can be accessed for further details. This **consolidated** view **orchestrates** the input and storage of new information.

## 3. Conclusion
This veterinary app **achieves** seamless user management and data handling by **utilizing** Firebase. Its structured interface **supports** ease of use for both end users and administrators in the context of animal care management, thus **strengthening** veterinary workflows and improving animal record keeping.
